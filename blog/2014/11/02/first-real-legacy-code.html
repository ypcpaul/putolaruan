  <p>Legacy code.  Rarely do these words be met with enthusiasm amongst devs.  Most programmers would like to code something current, new, trending.  It’s understandable, it’s fun to create your own than maintaining code that has been passed to you, especially those that are considered to be out of date.  However, most devs would run into legacy code, whether they like to or not.  That’s the case for me right now.</p>

<p>Personally, I do find creating new web apps more fun than handling old, established, stable code.  You get to experiment, do rapid prototypes, proof of concepts.  It’s exciting to see something you’ve developed to mature into something beautiful (although it can grow to be a monster too).  Modifying, maintaining or fixing old systems though, is usually not.  It can be frustrating, looking through the code and trying to understand why certain things are done in certain ways.  It feels like you’re an archeologist of software.  Sometimes, even trying to make it work on your machine can be tedious due to the application using and relying on outdated versions of either the language, the database, web server, or libraries.</p>

<p>6 years of working, and now I get to handle <em>true</em> legacy code.  Not just hand-me-down code.  It’s quite outdated in architecture, coding style, and practices.  However, I try to be optimistic.  I believe there are ways to make this experience more appealing, and I’m sure there are challenges ahead that I can learn a lot from.  Maybe there’s a treasure I can find somewhere here while cleaning the place up.  Wish me luck!</p>
